# About Jade

JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) is a middleware that facilitates the development of multi-agent systems (SMA).
JADE contains:
1. __Environment runtime__: the environment or the agents can live. This runtime
environment must be activated to be able to launch agents.
2. __Class library__: that developers use to write their agents.
3. __Graphical tools__: which facilitate the management and supervision of the agent
platform
